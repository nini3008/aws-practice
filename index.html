                <h3>AWS regions</h3>
                <p>AWS has many Data centers around the world. These are called regions. the blue dots are regions that exist today and orange dots are coming down the pipe</p>


                <p>A region is a cluster of data centers. most of the AWS services are region scoped</p>

                <p>Each region has many availability zones. usually 3, min is 2, max is 6.</p>

                <p>What is AWS Availability zones?  AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity. They are seperated from each other to avoid distasters. They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking</p>

                <p>This is the basis of how AWS works</p>

            <section id="iam">
                <h2>IAM</h2>
               <p>IAM stands for identity and Access Management</p>
               <p>Your whole AWS security is there: </p>
                <ul><li>Users</li><li>Groups</li><li>Roles</li></ul>
                <p>Root Account should never be shared</p>
                <p>Users must be created with proper permissions</p>
                <p>IAM is at the center of AWS</p>
                <p>policies are written in JSON</p>

                <p>Users - usually a physical person</p>
                <p>Roles - Internal usage within AWS resources. Specfically for the machine</p>
                <p>groups can functions(Admins, devops), teams(engineering, design,,). They contain users</p>
                <p>Policies defines what each can and cannot do.</p>

                <h4>IAM introduction</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>IAM has a global view</li>
                    <li>Permisions are governed by Policies(JSON)</li>
                    <li>MFA (Multifactor Authentication) can be setup</li>
                    <li>IAM has predefined 'managed policies'</li>
                    <li>its best to give users the minimal amount of permissions they need to perform their job(least privilege principles</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>IAM Federation </h4>
                <p>Big enterprises usually integrate their own repository of users with IAM</p>
                <p>Only Big enterprises uses this...nit part of the course but good to know for the exam</p>
                <p>Identity federation user the SAML standard (Active directory)</p>

                <h4>IAM 101 Brain Dump</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>One IAM user per physical person</li>
                    <li>One IAM role per application</li>
                    <li>IAM credentials should NEVER be shared</li>
                    <li>Never, ever,ever,ever, write IAM credentials in code. Ever</li>
                    <li>And even less, Never commit ypur IAM credentials</li>
                    <li>Never use the Root account except for initial setup</li>
                    <li>Never use Root IAM credentials</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)</h2>
                <h4>What is EC2?</h4>
                <p>EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS offering</p>
                <p>it mainly consists in the capability of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Renting virtual machines (EC2)</li>
                    <li>Storing data on virtual drives (EBS) </li>
                    <li>Distributing load across machines (ELB)</li>
                    <li>Scaling the services using an auto-scalling group (ASG)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the cloud works</p>

                <h4>Launching an EC2</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: click the create instance button</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</li>
                    <li>Step 3: choose an instance type</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Configure Instance details</li>
                    <li>Step 5: Add Storage</li>
                    <li>Step 6: Add tags</li>
                    <li>Step 7: Configure security groups</li>
                    <li>Step 8: Review</li>

                <h4>what can AWS be used for</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>AWS enables you to build sophisticated, scalable applications</li>
                    <li>Applicable to diverse set of industries</li>
                    <li>Use cases include: Enterprise IT, Backup & Storage, Big Data analytics; website hosting, Mobile & Social Apps (backend) or gaming</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>AWS Regions</h4>
                <p>AWS has regiols all around the world. Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3 etc. A region us a cluster of data centers. Most AWS services are region scoped</p>

                <h5>How to choose an AWS region? (possible exam question</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compliance with data governance and legal reqiurements: data never leaves a region withput explicit permission</li>
                    <li>Proximity to customers: reduced latency</li>
                    <li>Available Services with region: new servcies and new features aren't available in every region</li>
                    <li>Pricing: priving varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>AWS AVailabilty zones</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each region has mant availabily zones(usually 3, min 2, max is 6)</li>

                <h2>High Availability & Scalability</h2>
                <h3>Scalability</h3>
                <p>Scalability means that an application can handle greater loads by adapting</p>
                <p>There are two types of scalability: vertical scalabilty & Horizontal scalability(= elasticity)</p>

                <h4>Vertical scalability</h4>
                <p>Vertical Scalability means increasing the size of the instance</p>
                <p>For Example, Your application runs on a t2.micro. scalling that application vertically means running it on a t2.large.</p>
                <p>Verical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as a database. RDS, ElasticCache are services that can scale vertically. Theres usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale. (hardware limit</p>
                <h4>Horizontal scalability</h4>
                <p>Horizontal Scalability means increasing the number of instances/systems for your application</p>
                <p>Horizontal scaling implies distirbuted systems. This is very comming for web applications/mordern applications. its easy to Horizontal scale thanks to the cloud offerings such as Amazon EC2</p>
                <h3>High Availability</h3>
                <p>High Availability usualy goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling.</p>
                <p>High Scalability means running your applicayion/system in at least 2 data centers( == availability zones). The goal og high availability is to survive a data center loss. The high availability can be passive(for RDS Multi AZ for example). The high availability can be active for horizontal scaling.</p>

                <h2>Load Balancing</h2>
                <p>Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple services(EC2 instances( downstream)</p>
                <h4>why use a load balancer?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spread load across multiple downstream instances</li>
                    <li>Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application</li>
                    <li>Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances</li>
                    <li>Do regular health checks to your instances</li>
                    <li>Provide SSL termination(HTTPS) for your websites</li>
                    <li>Enforce stickiness with cookies</li>
                    <li>High availability across zones</li>
                    <li>Spparate public traffic from private traffic</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Why use an EC2 load Balancer?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>An ELB(EC2 load balance) is a managed load balancer.
                        <ol>
                            <li>AWS gaurantess that it will be working</li>
                            <li>AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high avaialibility</li>
                            <li>AWS provides only a few configuration knobs</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>it cost less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end</li>
                    <li>it is integrated with many AWS offerings/Services</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Health Checks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Health Checks are crucial for load balancers</li>
                    <li>They enable load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffice to are available to reply to requests</li>
                    <li>The health check is done on a portal and a route(/health is common</li>
                    <li>if the response is not 200(OK), then the instance is unhealthy</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Types of Load Balancer on AWS</h3>
                <p>AWS has 3 kinds of load balancers</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Classic Load Balancer(v1 - old generation) - 2009</li>
                    <li>Application Load Balancer(v2 - new generation) - 2016</li>
                    <li>Network Load Balancer(v2 - new generation) - 2017</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Overall is is recommnded to use newer/v2 generation load balancers as they provide more features. you can setup internal(private) or external (public) ELbS</p>
                <h4>Load balancer Good to know</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>LBs can scaled but not instantaneously - contact AWS for a "warm up"</li>
                    <li>Troubleshooting
                        <ul>
                            <li>4xx errors are client induces errors</li>
                            <li>5xx errors are application induced errors</li>
                            <li>Load balancer errors 503 means at capacity or no registerd target</li>
                            <li>if the LB can't connect to your application, check your security groyps</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Monitoring
                        <ul>
                            <li>ELB access logs will log all access requests (so you can debug per request)</li>
                            <li>CloudWatch Metrics will give you aggregrate statistics(ex: connections count)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Classic Load Balancers</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supports TCP (Layer 4), HTTP & HTTPS (Layer 7)</li>
                    <li>Health checks are TCP or HTTP based</li>
                    <li>Fixed hostname (xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com)</li>
